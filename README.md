# Topic Modeling Disney Reviews 

-   Author: Amelia Tang 

## About
Disney land is regarded as "The Happiest Place on Earth" by many according to U.S. News Travel (Anonymous 2021). This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project is to visualize and analyze the Disneyland Reviews data set I collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews). The dataset comprises approximately `42,000` reviews of three Disneyland locations: Paris, California, and Hong Kong. To facilitate data visualization, I created a Tableau story that provides an overview of ratings by branches and reviewer locations. For text data preprocessing, I performed basic text cleaning (e.g., removing digits), as well as `stemming` and `lemmatization`. In the project, I utilized two methods, `TextBlob` and `NLTK VADER`, for sentiment polarity analysis and compared the polarity scores assigned by both methods.

<br>For topic modeling, I utilized Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (`HDBSCAN`) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (`LDA`) models to identify clusters/topics. However, the topics are hard to interpret as both models do not output semantic topics.  

<br>Finally, I used prompt engineering and the ChatGPT `gpt-3.5-turbo` API to conduct sentiment/polarity analysis and topic inference. The results of sentiment analysis generated by ChatGPT generally agree with the results generated by `TextBlob` and `VADER`, implemented using `NLTK`. Among the Disney reviews, it seems that there are some popular topics, such as fireworks, queues, rides, and staff.
